    <h2>How to Make The Best Potato Soup</h2>
    <p>Potato Soup loaded with chunks of tender, hearty potatoes and made with a rich and creamy soup base. 
      This soup is a <em>cook's</em> favorite and for good reason – it’s easy to make and absolutely delicious! 
      Top it with cheddar and bacon and no one will be able to resist.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>

     
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep potatoes by scrubbing your potatoes clean, peeling, and then cutting them into about 2-inch chunks. Place the potatoes into a large soup pot (I use my Dutch oven) and cover with clean water and stir.</li>
      <li>Cook over medium heat until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain away the water from the potatoes.</li>
      <li>Add your whole milk and butter to the potatoes and place back on medium heat. Allow the milk to bubble slightly around the edges of the soup pot, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
